        I'm a creative and passionate designer currently studying Interactive Media Design in Canada. 
        This journey has pushed me to explore new technologies and ideas I never thought I could master.
        <br><br>
        Iâ€™m originally from Mexico and moved with my family to build a better future while continuing to grow professionally and personally.
        <br><br>
        I love hiking, reading personal development books, and connecting with people through creativity and collaboration.
