      <p class="card-text fs-4">
        At 42, I completed a diploma that has been one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences of my life.
        It helped me grow, pushed me beyond my limits, and made me realize I am capable of more than I ever imagined.
        One of the most enriching aspects has been meeting people from all over the world and sharing this journey with them.
